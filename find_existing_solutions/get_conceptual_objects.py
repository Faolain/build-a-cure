    this function is checking for any purpose-related keywords
    to find priority data of bio components, 
    like 'bacteria seek to optimize efficiency' would return 'efficiency'

    if something (object, process, attribute) is a known output of a function, 
        its assumed to be the intent

    this should capture the core intent which should be one of the supported intents
    all intents are inherently relationships so most could be standardized to:
     'find', 'test', 'build', 'compare', or 'verify'
    but you want to find which one fits more given their subtle differences
    for example:
        - 'test' indicates a known relationship was tested
        - 'find' indicates a new relationship was tested

        - 'verify' indicates replication of a research object (result, study)
        - 'compare' indicates analysis of related research objects (study/study, result/protocol)

        - 'build' contains instructions on how to synthesize something
        - 'find' would indicate info about a relationship between the input & output in the study, 
            but not necessarily include the instructions

    for studies that have a 'test' intent (to confirm a theorized relationship),
        the relationship youre trying to find is between:
         'method'/'compound' and 'success'/'failure'
    for other studies that are exploratory (to find a new relationship),
        the relationship may be to find correlation between two medical factors:
        'condition' and 'treatment' or 'condition' and 'symptom' or 'treatment' and 'symptom'
