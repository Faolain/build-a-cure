# Problems with Current Analysis

## Statistics

### Evaluating variables in isolation

- the variable interactions usually studied aren't normally indexed by causal metadata like causal adjacency (direct vs. indirect cause) or causal shape

- causal shape analysis is crucial for identifying variables that can be collapsed into other variables, replaced with others, or if there are likely sets of variables that influence the target variable

### Checking variables for predictive power instead of predicting variable metadata & sets first

- system metadata should have a minimum of information that can enable identifying probable variable sets

- then predictive functions should be quicker to build, because the solution space is drastically reduced by the system analysis identifying probable variable sets
