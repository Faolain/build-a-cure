## Concept Operations

  - meaning comes from attributes like:
    - reduction of signals (relevance)
    - matching of signal structures (similarity)

  - the reason entropy can evolve on its own is that if order was the default, it wouldnt allow order (in the form of alignments) to be constructed for a particular efficient purpose (like making a trade or cooperating) and then automatically deconstructed by entropy when no longer used. Efficiencies may be rare & temporary enough that order shouldnt be the default so disorder can allow more interactions to occur and more efficiencies can be found naturally. It's similar to the free market allowing companies to organize & operate without regulation to find efficiencies in demand/supply.

  - this is the set of core conceptual math operations between concepts

  I. combine (expand, add, set)

    1. merge with override/backup/overlap rules
      "power merged with information" => 
        "power as an input to information" => "powerful position can use information at increased scale & impact"
        "information as an input to power" => "insights"
        (can continue merging with each object interacting with the other & its attributes/types/rules)

    2. collide (compete for position)
      "power or information" => "is power different from information in this context" => "do other objects enable functionality, beyond information, or is information the key enabler"

    3. intersection (retain common components)
      "common components of power & information" => "enablement, context, control, dependence, responsibility"

    4. union (retain all components)
      "power and information" => "multiple power types, creating a backup system of control if one power source fails"

  II. filter (find, reduce, subtract, subset)

    - x without y
      - "power without information" => "information-derivation method", "power from non-information source", "limited power"

  III. apply (expand, group, iterate, multiply, set)

    - apply to another (x * y)
      - "balance of power" = "symmetry between input & output dependencies"

    - apply to itself (x ^ n)
      - "power of power" => "the enabler of enabling" => "input", "abstraction", "coordination"

  IV. standardize (simplify, compare, divide, subset)

    - x standardized by y
      - "power standardized by power" => 
        "power explained by power" => 
        "explain power using only objects in power definition (input/output/objects)" =>
        "enabling happens from providing inputs to a high proportion of other objects or to very important objects (having important, causative, or many connections)" => 
        "high ratio or symmetry of power object outputs: important object inputs or high causation ratio" 
          (given that important objects can be powerful just because they enable many other objects, even if they dont provide all of the inputs of other objects)


## Concept Derivation

  - identifying unique objects in a system that cant be defined in terms of standard operations on other objects

    example:
    - power cant be defined as a simple combination of other objects in the networks it participates in, because its an abstract property having many possible implementations, all having one thing in common, which is the role/behavior of "enabler/enabling", and power is therefore occupying more than one semantic layer, as it can be an object, role, function, input/output, depending on which structure is more relevant to the host system for this implementation of power

    - however, defining it in terms of these possible structures it occupies (input, role, function) is too simplistic - for example you cant define power as simply "an input" because while that is true, given its enabling functionality, it leaves out a lot of information and fails to distinguish it from other inputs, which may not be powerful since they are common or easily substituted with alternatives

    - even defining power by its core unifying function "enabling" is too simplistic because often power does more than just enable something, given the connectedness of systems - meaning that enable one thing often disables another thing in the system or an adjacent system, which creates effects other than enabling, as the disabled process may disable the original enabled process down the causal path

  - therefore we can conclude that abstractions are concepts that:

    - can take many structures (the concept of equivalence has many possible implementations)

    - can impact many systems varying by system attributes or system types (abstract, calculatable, variable, understood, types, functional, prioritized, optimized)

    - cannot be perfectly defined as a simple function of other objects, but rather are definable with a set of simple, core boundary rules that differentiate them from other concepts
      - these boundary rules do not involve other concepts on the same layer, but rather core components
      - for example, the core components of common shapes are: line, point, curve, corner
      - the set of common shapes are the uniquely identifiable combinations of these components (circle, square, triangle) that are not identifiable as simple transforms of other common shapes, but rather are composed of simple limit rules based on their core components (line, point, curve, corner)

      - "enablement" doesnt perfectly capture "power", and the concept of "enablement" also relies on the concept of "power", but it does differentiate power from other concepts & unite its possible implementations & meanings
      - "symmetry" doesnt perfectly capture "balance"
      - "similarity" or "substitutability" or "identity" doesnt perfectly capture "equivalence"

    - are uniquely identifiable compared to other concepts
      - balance is related to symmetry so these are not unique concepts but embedded/dependent/overlapping/hierarchical concepts
      - however balance is clearly differentiable from power, as balance inherently involves equivalence and power doesnt, whereas power inherently involves enablement and balance doesnt
