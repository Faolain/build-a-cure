# Concept Operations


## Specific Concepts


  ### Time

  - time can be defined as:
    - how many systems are capable of interacting on the same interface layer & the trajectory across the manifold of possible interaction combinations of those systems
      - whether other layers of interaction are system-adjacent (possible) or whether interface physics prohibits interactions on those layers for this system interaction trajectory (timeline)

    - if a variable changes with time (possible variance), that doesnt mean time (possible variance) caused its variance, 
      but the system collisions enabling the set of interactions possible in that layer

    - the flow of system molecules follows a physics that should be able to explain system change rules
    - the key question is: what is the system (set of core functions) that could generate the set of possible systems we assume exist, 
      and what host system could enable these core functions to result in combinations explaining those systems?
    - what is the host system in which system molecules exist? its modelable as a network with different states (structural math layer) in a particular interface (core dimension set)
    - what is the path between the math layer & the others that allows the math layer to contain its own internal rules and also capture all other rules?
      - the math layer is so important bc its the rules of value & structure, & it's relevant when we can observe/measure other systems to the point of being able to assign value & structure
      - systems that cannot be measured can be guessed but not proven, unless the set of proofs leaves only one possibility for that system's position
      - if there is only one possibility left to the question that explains the variance in this universe, then time doesnt exist in this universe
      - the point wouldnt be to predict future behavior, but to derive source rules of the universe
        & then optimize them for a universe where time could exist (every question cannot be answered in that universe)
        & then detail the steps necessary to trace that universe to this one
      - if there is a universe where every question can be answered, it might poison adjacent universes with its certainty, so they might pool their variance to introduce chaos to that one
        if there are remaining problems to solve in those other universes (systems with non-determinable winners using info available inside the universe, in that state)
      - information has to leak to preserve variance in this system
    - when you standardize the other layers to the position interface, it can be captured in the math layer
    - what is the causal relationship between these layers? does math cascade into the others or just capture their structure, once it decays into information?
    - math is the unit system in the system layer, just like information is the unit object in the conceptual layer (unit/key object: out of which all other objects are built)

  - example of a different conceptual system:
    - if power favored centralization, another core concept like balance would have to favor a chaotic process or not exist at all, or another core concept would need to be added to the network


  ### Meaning (Relevance/Structure)

  - meaning comes from attributes like:
    - reduction of signals (relevance)
    - matching of signal structures (similarity)


  ### Entropy/variance

  - the reason entropy can evolve on its own is that if order was the default, it wouldnt allow order (in the form of alignments) to be constructed for a particular efficient purpose (like making a trade or cooperating) and then automatically deconstructed by entropy when no longer used. Efficiencies may be rare & temporary enough that order shouldnt be the default so disorder can allow more interactions to occur and more efficiencies can be found naturally. It's similar to the free market allowing companies to organize & operate without regulation to find efficiencies in demand/supply.

  
## Concept Derivation

  - identifying unique objects in a system that cant be defined in terms of standard operations on other objects

    example:
    - power cant be defined as a simple combination of other objects in the networks it participates in, because its an abstract property having many possible implementations, all having one thing in common, which is the role/behavior of "enabler/enabling", and power is therefore occupying more than one semantic layer, as it can be an object, role, function, input/output, depending on which structure is more relevant to the host system for this implementation of power

    - however, defining it in terms of these possible structures it occupies (input, role, function) is too simplistic - for example you cant define power as simply "an input" because while that is true, given its enabling functionality, it leaves out a lot of information and fails to distinguish it from other inputs, which may not be powerful since they are common or easily substituted with alternatives

    - even defining power by its core unifying function "enabling" is too simplistic because often power does more than just enable something, given the connectedness of systems - meaning that enable one thing often disables another thing in the system or an adjacent system, which creates effects other than enabling, as the disabled process may disable the original enabled process down the causal path

  - therefore we can conclude that abstractions are concepts that:

    - can take many structures (the concept of equivalence has many possible implementations)

    - can impact many systems varying by system attributes or system types (abstract, calculatable, variable, understood, types, functional, prioritized, optimized)

    - cannot be perfectly defined as a simple function of other objects, but rather are definable with a set of simple, core boundary rules that differentiate them from other concepts
      - these boundary rules do not involve other concepts on the same layer, but rather core components
      - for example, the core components of common shapes are: line, point, curve, corner
      - the set of common shapes are the uniquely identifiable combinations of these components (circle, square, triangle) that are not identifiable as simple transforms of other common shapes, but rather are composed of simple limit rules based on their core components (line, point, curve, corner)

      - "enablement" doesnt perfectly capture "power", and the concept of "enablement" also relies on the concept of "power", but it does differentiate power from other concepts & unite its possible implementations & meanings
      - "symmetry" doesnt perfectly capture "balance"
      - "similarity" or "substitutability" or "identity" doesnt perfectly capture "equivalence"

    - are uniquely identifiable compared to other concepts
      - balance is related to symmetry so these are not unique concepts but embedded/dependent/overlapping/hierarchical concepts
      - however balance is clearly differentiable from power, as balance inherently involves equivalence and power doesnt, whereas power inherently involves enablement and balance doesnt
