## Derivation/fitting methods

  I. Differentiation
    - what is the path definitely not, based on various maximized measures of similarity?
    - what variance is unexplained
    - what attributes & attribute sets & attribute dependency trees differ
    - what is transformation cost/potential between objects
    - what is divergence distance between generative paths for each object
    - example:
      "what is the probable function linking these variables, 
      given that it is an adjacent transform of a square (related function type),
      and is a distant transform of a manifold (unrelated function type)?"

  II. Pattern analysis
    - what would the path between inputs/output be, given patterns of other paths?
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given common function patterns between variables of these types/topics/ranges/other metadata?"

  III. Organization analysis
    - optimal path/distribution/states
    - what would the optimal path be, given a certain intent, object identity, & host system?
    - "what is the function linking these variables that is most efficient/involves fewest variables/involves known constants?"

  IV. Causal analysis
    - given the position between these causal factors, which causal patterns are likeliest?
    - "given that a species occupies an interim position between evolution, efficiency, time, and environment, what is the likeliest causal shape linking a species with its environment?"
      - for more evolved organisms, this is a network causal shape, though species with less developed cognitive ability may have simple or uni-directional shapes with environment
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given these functions linking other adjacent generating variables/functions further up/down the causal shape"

  V. Type analysis
    - given a known type stack progression, what is the likeliest position or extension of that stack?
    - "given that these species evolved this way, what level of variance is the missing link between them likely to have?"
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the type stacks of the function objects (dimensions, adjacent functions, identifiable shapes, etc)"

  VI. System analysis
    - what known/potential inputs/outputs available in the system could build the path?
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the core functions used to build this system?"

  VII. Intent analysis
    - what intents/directions/priorities does this path align with or could be built from?
    - "what is the function linking these variables, given the variable intents a, b, c and the combination intent matrix ab, bc, ca, and the possible output intents of that matrix, and similarity to output intent of y"

  VIII. Variable analysis
    - variable accretion
    - at what point does a variable become relevant to another variable interaction layer?
    - how do constants accrete between rules, like caps to keep variance from flowing in to corners or creating boundary-invalidating openings in a system/component boundary?
    - what causes variables to cascade across layers, creating fractal variables?
    - delegation of variance into systems/types/functions/variables/constants

  IX. Functional analysis 
    - distortion (gap creation, divergence)
    - filling (gap closing, convergence)
    - fitting (path/structure derivation, path evolution in isolation & with other factors)
    - function types
      - change functions (applicable to all other function types)
      - limit/boundary functions
      - intent functions
    - function attributes
      - alignment: enforced/optional, core, required, emergent/output (built from core functions, with or without associated intent)
      - interaction: cooperative/conflicting
      - intent: generative, filtering, grouping, organization/delegation/distribution/matching/grouping/filtering, classification, differentiation/transformation
      - scope: abstract, contextual

  X. Interface analysis
    - determining position/trajectory on interface
    - selecting interface as best standard for comparison
    - identifying all interfaces with variance that cant be captured in other interfaces

  XI. Conceptual analysis
    - deriving unique concepts & their relationships
    - deriving output intents of concept combinations
    - fitting concept combinations to structures

  XII. Structural analysis
    - identify shape: chain/stack/network/mix/layer
    - identify adjacent shapes
    - identify compression functions of shape given target dimensions
    - identify transformation functions of shape given source/target shape
    - identify alignments/symmetries/gaps/conflicts
