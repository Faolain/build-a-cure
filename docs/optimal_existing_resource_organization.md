Here are some ways to rearrange society's resources that don't involve huge investments

- college debt: if college grads or current students want to pay off college debt, let them do useful science research or build useful tools out of a national index of tools needed, in return for college credit

- homeless living situation: 
	- let homeless people live in the houses the government hires them to build if they're willing to work for a basic salary or be paid in housing when they're done, and they can continue building cheap homes for other people if they want to continue making money
	- cheap housing tools (cement-house building machine, other methods of building cheap shelters & infrastructure to support them)
	- cheap land after reducing demand for goods produced by that land (reducing meat consumption will reduce land needed by livestock)
	- recycling wood products/reversing burning process can lower amount of land needed for forests
	- tools to lower carbon dioxide can reduce dependence on forests
	- tools to convert ice-covered areas or other areas considered non-livable to livable land
	- reduce land that takes the largest area to produce lowest value goods (vineyards, etc) if those products can be produced in labs or if demand for them can be reduced
	- tools to distribute land to extend coastlines
	- tools to make living on ocean cheaper for homeless people/increasing wildlife or food-generation tools without unbalancing ecosystems

- prizes for the most useful research solutions stored on a website (change.org, etc) such as:
	- problem-solving automation tools
	- tool frameworks like popular code libraries to build other tools
	- tool to make addictive drugs/plants non-addictive
	- tool to make crops hyper-productive
	- tool to make clean energy out of sunlight/water/air elements/waste
	- tool to test product quality (medicine, air filter, water quality, etc)
	- tool to convert harmful product into harmless product (tablet to remove aspartame from coca cola or bpa from contents of a can)
	- tool to convert products no longer in demand into source materials that can be used to make new products

- solution market management:
	- in order to make everyone a solution supplier (equally able to solve their own problems or solve problems for other people), they need problem solving tools:
		- computer/cell phone
		- electricity
		- wi-fi
		- education (comes with wi-fi, if theyre pointed to the right resources)
		- basic resources to live (shelter, water, medicine)
	- people with more problems than they can fix themselves (malnourished brains) can contribute as research subjects/solution testers

- debt market management:
	- debt markets essentially involve trading beliefs in the value of something (someone's earning potential, the value of a degree, the future value of someone's health, or future value of a product, or potential user base/research/product delivery of a company)
	- in order to resolve debt markets so that resources are distributed in a more optimal manner, you can arrange beliefs using economic tools that engineer beliefs (advertisements, trade wars, taxes)
	- beliefs can be arranged optimally with optimal transport to make the trades that will allocate resources where theyre most needed & most justified, like the trades you make in tetris

	- example: 
		- advertise/subsidize demand for a product that is about to be less demanded 
			(meat, soy, stevia, aspartame) 
		- invent a tool to change it into something that is closer to the next demanded product or supplementary to current & next demanded product
			(soy with allergen removed, seasoning to make both soy & imminent soy replacements taste better, which would have steady demand in either market)
		- then producers can invest in the next-demanded product 
			(alt milk sources like almond with lower economic impact & allergen content, monk fruit, agave syrup, high-salt goods to replace high-sugar goods)

- investment market management:
	- investments are incentivized beliefs
	- once the money is invested, there's profits to be made by fulfilling that belief
	- investments should be based on as high a proportion of fact as possible without stifling potential adaptation of the solution implementation
	- meaning the product plan should be clear & well-thought out & based on verified understanding, but allow room for adapting the implementation method in case a flaw is found later

- invention market management:
	- the value of an invention is based on the problem space (existing resource distribution & tech resources)
	- to make an invention more valuable, the problem space can be adjusted to change demand/dependence on that tech
	- example:
		- a tool to improve the genome of a particular plant to be extra-productive is only valuable if you dont have a tool that can produce & ripen any plants from a standard genome
		- a water filtration tool is only valuable if the infrastructure still allow contaminated water to pass to consumers
		- a particular energy source is only valuable if there isnt a cleaner, cheaper, more efficient, more adaptive, more self-repairing, and more accessible alternative
	- in any problem space, there are a finite set of inventions that have value
	- which inventions have the most value depends on the problem space structure as well as the invention metadata
		- production cost
		- accessibility of inputs
		- whether inputs already exist or need to be built
		- regulatory support, barriers, or loopholes
		- competition that can optimize the invention implementation or hinder it with legal or info entities (patents, intellectual property, trade secrets, information leaks, false information, lack of info security, corporate spies, exploitative employment disincentivizing employees, conflict between agencies in hidden goverments of emotions & grudges)
		- maximum demand/supply potential
		- existing products solving different aspects of the problem or adjacent problems, insights needed to produce the invention, etc)
		- probability & timeline of invalidating invention being released to the market

- insight market management:
	- the value of an insight has an expiration date that progresses from its discovery date, the point when it becomes common knowledge, to the point where it becomes automated, and the point when it begins to be over-assumed & starts to decay, until it eventually reaches 0 value.
	- example:
		- assuming p-value is a good way to assess study results used to be an insight but now the field has progressed to the point where people recognize the limits of isolated analysis & simplistic metrics that use constants or a single metric to evaluate the accidental potential of an observed relationship, so anyone still using that as an assumption is headed for failure


Other cheap ways include:
- moving people to cities so it's less costly to help them
- manipulating demand/supply to reward suppliers most in need (advertising their products more or subsidizing their acquisition of resources to make them competitive with privileged suppliers)
- network analysis to identify demanders/suppliers who can provide the best ROI (influencers, best educators, social network hubs, best adapters, best learners, best sharers, etc)
- network analysis to identify optimal products/inventions/research/trades/markets to subsidize
- network analysis to identify best method of increasing value of a good (advertisement, bundled goods, conflict trades, resource allocation/matching/distribution, subsidies, taxes, regulation, investment, idea sharing, optimization/competition/innovation incentive alignment)

Examples of previous methods:
- global agreements to allocate land & other resources to optimal identified global uses
- visa allotments to enable labor trades w/ minimal transaction costs
- reward most efficient suppliers w/ research tools to keep adapting to changing demand
- allow buy-in to networks of optimized markets output by optimal transport algorithms applied to market objects (resources, demand/supply, laws, etc) which reward users more the more people participate
	By 'optimized market networks', I mean a system that has determined the optimal set of products/inventions/incentives/labor/research/trades/trade loops/info/laws in an optimal series of problem spaces to optimize resource distribution for the most agents
- vice markets (allocate terrorists as prison guards to make vices valuable)
- virtue markets (allocate people who still have patience & desire to help so that this resource is not exhausted & they have time to recharge)
- applying prior demand cycles to allocate resources to new markets (if demand for meat is declining in industrialized areas, allocate meat products/production to unindustrialized areas until that demand declines, then keep moving market until demand is exhausted)
