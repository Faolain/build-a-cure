## Determining minimum information to solve a problem

  - with a line in a space, you have this information:
    - the type of change
    - the change rate
    - the angle compared to a standard, like an axis
    - its distance
  - and you need to know the following to find its equation:
    - whether its a segment or the full line
    - the space its in
  - with cancer you need to know
    - its position in the system
    - its input resources
    - its limits
    - its change methods (stress-handling methods, learning methods, etc)
    - whether it converts to other objects (like other cancers or a pathogen) & how
    - its history (how did it evolve)
    - its types
    - its target priorities
    - its cooperative agents (which organisms it helps or can receive help from)
    - how it interacts with other objects (that arent immediately classifiable as resources or targets)

  - given different information, you can use different methods
  - some methods are immune to information but most require a clear minimum

## Problem Solving Operations

  I. Match problem & solution using definition & standardization, applying increasing limits until problem & solution match

    - get a problem, standardize & define it: 
      problem: "funds cannot always be verified to exist with existing currencies"
      standardize: 
        "there is no way to check prior transaction info to determine funds availability"
        "transaction info exists in isolation of other transaction info"

    - define solution requirements: 
      "must be usable by any trader", 
      "transactions must be verified", 
      "must be relatively quick to enable normal transactions"
      + standard currency definition attributes

    - reduce problem into necessary solution boundary:
        "transaction info exists in isolation of other transaction info"
        "group transaction info" (transaction log)

    - apply solution requirements to solution boundary to check if its sufficient:

      apply(requirements, "group transaction info") => 
        still has problem "transactions are still isolated from previous transactions so previous transactions can be faked to give illusion of funds"

    - iterate same process, with new problem "previous transactions can still be faked"

    - standardize:
      "previous transactions are editable"

    - reduce problem into necessary solution boundary:

      "make previous transactions not-editable"

    - apply solution requirements to solution boundary to check if its sufficient:

      apply(requirements, "make previous transactions not-editable") =>
        still has problem "cannot check that each transaction is based on a non-edited transaction history"

    - iterate same process, with new problem "cant verify each transaction's transaction history"

    - standardize: "make sure each transaction is using correct transaction history"

    - reduce problem into solution boundary:

      "make sure each transaction is using correct transaction history" => "give software doing each transaction access to correct transaction history"     

    - apply solution requirements to check if its sufficient:

      apply(requirements, "give software doing each transaction access to correct transaction history") =>
        still has problem "transaction software might not have access to correct transaction history"

    - iterate with new problem "transaction software might not have access to correct transaction history"

    - standardize: "access to transaction history is not guaranteed"

    - reduce problem to solution boundary:

      "include transaction history in each transaction process"

    - apply requirements & check if its sufficient:
      apply(requirements, "include transaction history in each transaction process") =>
        still has problem: "if software process cant fetch transaction history, the transaction is not verifiable"

    - iterate with new problem "software process needs guaranteed access to transaction history"

    - standardize: "transaction history needs to be an input to the software process" (do_transaction() function)

    - reduce problem into solution boundary:

      "transaction history needs to be an input to the software process" => "transaction history is a parameter to do_transaction() function"

    - apply requirements & check if sufficient:
      apply(requirements, "transaction history is a parameter to do_transaction() function") => 

      still has problem: "if param is not populated, transaction cannot be done"

    - iterate with new problem "tx history param is not guaranteed to be populated"

    - standardize "make sure tx history is guaranteed to be populated"

    - reduce to solution boundary:

      "make sure tx history is guaranteed to be populated" => "add tx history further up causal chain so its embedded in guaranteed input to do_transaction(), like the transaction itself"

    - apply & check if sufficient:

      apply(requirements, "add tx history further up causal chain so its embedded in guaranteed input to do_transaction(), like the transaction itself") => solved

    - further requirements can be added to the solution with the same procedure (hash to make the tx log shorter, etc)


  II. Solve problem with structure fitting

    - rather than sculpting an invention using an increasing set of limits, you can select or derive a structure that probably matches, then check if it fits

    1. using the requirements of a solution, design a structure (or range of structures) that may match the problem space

    2. check if it fits the problem space

      - 'fits the problem' means it:

        - fills in gaps of the problem if the problem root cause is a lack of something (missing info or resources)
        - corrects alignment of vectors in the problem if the problem root cause is a misalignment (misaligned incentives, priorities, etc)
        - reduces problem dimension if the problem root cause is complexity (too many factors to measure, doesnt fit existing tools, can be solved if broken into smaller problems)

    example:

      - derive possible structures given the problem definition & the set of target concepts:

        - problem root cause (problem type) of "requiring trust" is "lack of information"
        - how can you use concepts (uniqueness, randomness, relevance, trustless) and the standard transaction structure to create a "trustless transaction"?
        - you already have a standard structure for a transaction (two nodes, exchange of resources each node has using connection between nodes, each node has different information resources)

        - now you can either use general distortion methods & topical distortion methods to design a new structure to solve the problem, or you can add distortions based on which distortions would produce optimized relationships between structure nodes to find the structure that is likeliest to solve problem

          1. query to retrieve common distorting functions of successful inventions (combine, embed, randomize, rotate) or existing alternate transaction types (privatize, encrypt, publish, verify)
            and apply these and combinations of these and check each output transaction structure to see if it fits problem space

          2. or start with standard structure of a transaction and add distortions based on which distortions would fulfill intents leading to target concept combinations "trustless transaction"

            1. start with standard transaction structure 

            2. which distorting operation might reduce trust (info asymmetries) required in transaction?

               - distribute information by adding it to both sides until its equal (both entities have the information)
               - distribute information by removing it from both sides until its equal (neither entity has the information)
               - distribute information to a third party (encrypted or inaccessible information store that can provide zero-knowledge proofs of contents)
            
            3. key objects of distorting operations are: information, distribution, balance, sides

            4. find requirements for relationships between distorting operation objects:
              - which sides need to be balanced in information in the first place?
                - each participant in a transaction (balance in information between requester & sender of funds)
                - each third party node verifying & executing transactions (balance in information between transaction log and new transaction)
            
            5. find structures to achieve requirements

              - what distorted transaction structure can balance information between transaction log and new transaction?

                - given the standard transaction structure & the distorting operation ("distribute information by adding it to both sides"),
                  what is the new transaction structure after applying this distorting operation that fulfills the overall priority of "reduce required trust"?
                    - implementation of distorting operation to problem objects "add information to the transaction that balances its information distribution with the transaction log"
                    - apply distorting operation implementation to problem space: 
                      - "which information does the transaction log have that the transaction does not?"
                      - "transaction log has history of prior transactions, which the standard transaction structure does not"
                    - check if applied distorting operation implementation moves problem space toward priority (trustless) or reduces problem dimension (info asymmetry):
                      "does including transaction log (or subset of it) with transactions reduce trust required (info asymmetry between prior & current transactions)?"


  III. Solve problem with solution function selection

    - should be possible to estimate the value added by choosing a path between equivalent-seeming alternatives before its clear which one is correct, 
      given the variable networks/layers & metadata (structure, complexity) of the variance between alternative paths, 
      & relative to problem space metadata (path optimization metrics, intent)
      as well as which path will probably be correct, with increasing certainty given additional metadata,
      based on variable complexity relationships and other metadata relationships

    - lets say youve derived a network of possible functions to achieve a certain goal
      - how do you choose whether to narrow it down further or accept this level of variance in your solution set, requiring a context to select a particular function from the set?
      - if its unclear whether an alternative metric/metric value is optimal 
        (metrics or metric values are similar & differences arent clearly relevant to goal)
        thats a good candidate network for postponing the selection to selection demand time

    - for each problem dimension, there is a set of functions that can reduce the problem dimension to a point, by finding the formula for the shape of that problem dimension (like a line)

      - there are many ways to build a formula for a line, but the best ways usually:

        - fulfill an attribute (such as simplicity, least number of transformation operations, shortest distance between points, definition of similarity such as adjacence)
        - match existing unique formulaic patterns (a unique formula cant be classified as just a transform of another formula)
        - use existing resources (if you have x & y, a solution formula using x & y to reduce problem dimension x is more optimal)

      - example:
        - a problem space has several dimensions, one of which is missing information or conflicting incentives
        - a solution formula to reduce these dimensions might be a formula to get or derive information, or a formula to align incentives

    - identifying which function combinations are used optimally elsewhere and which function combinations havent been used is another function selection mechanism

    - the evolution of functional layers (core to interim to output functions) is another source of insights on system development & design

    - determining which interfaces, attributes & concepts determine the biggest difference in function performance 
      (scale physics, structure physics, info physics, causal shapes, change physics, logic, types, dimension sets, metric selection, complexity, etc)

      - selecting standard model for optimal problem reduction into components 
        (framing it as a task suitable for organizational, optimal transport, route optimization, distribution, position assignment, sequence ordering model, etc)

      - selecting adjacent models that existing problem structure can be converted/broken into (system molecules forming problem structures)


  IV. Solve problem with Conceptual Query

    - get a conceptual combination with a query of problem space & find an abstract structure that fits this combination, then find a specific structure that fits the combination

    - example:

        Input concepts:
          - uniqueness
          - randomness
          - symmetry
          - relevance

        Input relationship network:
          - uniqueness on both sides of a symmetry can be used for verification
          - relevance can organize information where its value is optimized
          - the value of information is optimized when its distributed
          - distributing information on both sides of a symmetry would allow verification of new information
          - symmetries exist between types (two objects of a type, such as a transaction)

        Now we will look for intents & structures that could alert us to problem spaces where this conceptual insight network would be useful.

        Concept Intents:
          - verification (uniqueness, randomness, symmetry, relevance)
          - distribution (symmetry, relevance)

        General Structures:
          - communication structures (internet)
          - storage structures (log, database, hash function)
          - combination structures (log, database, function, distance, similarity)
          - interaction structures (relevant properties, interacting relationship functions between objects)

        Conceptual Solution Boundary Requirements:
          - in order for uniqueness to be useful as an identifier, it must be paired with each object to identify (tx id + tx)

        Conceptual Boundary Decomposition:
          - combining unique identifiers enhances uniqueness (tx id + tx log hash)
          - uniqueness enables using uniqueness symmetries for verification (uniqueness of tx log hash would probably only perfectly match a specific tx log's hash)
          - verification also requires symmetry in verification ability (all parties involved must have access to info needed to verify)
          - tx log is an asset everyone has access to
          - tx log has a unique hash
          - combining unique tx log hash with tx id pairs information by relevance (each tx has a related tx log history)
          - each tx also has a required range of tx log histories, that would allow the tx to take place 
            (any log history enabling the transaction, which allows the transaction to happen - meaning the funds exist & are valid)
          - each log history used for new tx must have symmetry (match) with log history of other traders (must be accurate)

        Output conceptual relationship structure (this is the network of rules representing the invention):
          - host information in the object that requires it, for each object to be a source of verification that also uses verification as an input
          - tx objects need to be symmetric in some way with other tx objects (tx log provides the symmetry to conduct match/check operations)
          - tx objects need to be unique in some way compared to other tx objects (tx id/tx log hash)
          - embed the logs needed to verify new tx in each new tx
          - by combining uniqueness identifiers, aligning information symmetries, or organizing by relevance, the tx funds can be verified using the tx history
            - three different conceptual paths to arrive at the same conclusion: "include hash of the prior tx log with the new tx log entry"
  
        Specific Problem Space Structures:
          - log
          - transaction metadata
          - internet
          - tx log/ledger/database
          - hash function

        Output concept-structure matches:
        - uniqueness: tx log should have a unique hash
        - randomness: any node can verify, equally likely to be able to verify, have same resources such as tx log & software
        - symmetry: 
          - tx log should match the claim of each transaction
          - ledger has embedded concept of balance in asset trade amounts & assets
          - matching of information supply & demand (allocate tx history to tx metadata, where it has most value)


  V. Solve problem with Conceptual Combination Metadata query

  - if you know that a certain configuration of uniqueness & randomness can output a lack of predictability, and you know that a lack of predictability means randomness can be verified (trust in randomness is not required), then for any problem with a target intent of "verifying randomness", or similar intents ("verifying information", "correcting info asymmetry", "not requiring trust"),
      you can match that configuration of uniqueness & randomness with the problem and see if it reduces the problem dimensions (solves the problem)

  - this can also be abstracted:
    - rather than storing "uniqueness/randomness config => unpredictability", you can store:
      - "consistent variance => upredictability"
      - "consistent variance => randomness"
      - "distributed variance == randomness"
    - these abstract rules between conceptual configurations (a combination of concepts in a particular structure, like a system) can generalize the configuration to more problem spaces

  - these abstracted configurations have different metadata (intent, priority, logic flow, variance level, causation) and can therefore be useful in different (possibly meaning "additional") circumstances than the original configuration
