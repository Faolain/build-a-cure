# Test cases

## Conditions

	- Identify the processes & bio markers related to the condition as you go through search results so you can do secondary searches
		- target metric to inhibit/increase
		- cooperative metrics: synergistic compounds that enhance the effect of drugs without debilitating side effects
			- search for these & the stressors that deactivate/activate them
				Example: MUC1 - bacteria exposed to a split tail activates it
		- antagonistic metrics: any compounds that can neutralize the drug & the supplements/foods that contain them
			- get these inhibitors by looking up existing treatment pharmacokinetics/dynamics & interactions
				- search for inhibit, induce, substrate
				- check for synergistic effects & any effects that prevent the drug from being metabolized, which may be required to activate it
				- once you find a treatment, you need to check it against context provided by user to filter the list of treatments or style it differently
		- metrics further up the causal stack 
			- if you decrease hunger, diabetes doesnt happen, which is also a treatment (fasting)

### I. diabetes 

	- treatments should include: 
		- amylase & glucosidase inhibitors (caffeoyl, galloyl, and prenyl groups)
		- berberine
		- carb blockers like white kidney bean extract
		- insulin
		- fasting
		- sweet defeat (sugar taste blockers)
		- as well as any compounds that can target the processes/receptors involved (ghrelin, metabolism, dopamine, GLUT-4 receptor) 

	- treatment strategies should include:
		- inhibit glucose absorption 
		- insulin-mimicking activity
		- enhanced glucose uptake
		- regulation of insulin signaling pathways
		- translocation of GLUT-4 receptor 
		- activation of the PPARγ

###  II. fungal meningitis 

	- treatments should include:
		- carvacrol, thymol, eugenol
		- sertraline
		- ecgc
		- inhibitors of CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 
		- azole drugs
		- any other substances that can bind to the fungal cell membrane or process ergosterol into something harmless

	- treatment strategies should include:
		- convert ergosterol to vitamin d
		- bind to ergosterol to break fungal cell membrane

	- insights should include:
		- inhibits [cytochrome p450] enzyme [14α-demethylase] in fungus but not mammals
		- inhibiting [cytochrome p450] enzyme [14α-demethylase] prevents production of ergosterol from lanosterol & accumulation of [14α-methyl] sterols
		- ergosterol is a required input of the fungal cell membrane
		- breaking cell components [membranes] is a way to kill an organism
		- once you break the membrane, your system can handle the components of the cell
		- required inputs (enzymes) to inputs (ergosterol) of object components [cell membranes] are a key target to break those components
			(this insight should already exist in your insight db without those specifics)
		- some natural processes break cell membranes

	- standard system analysis questions should include:
		- what are the limits of your system handling broken fungal cells?
		- does combination therapy work (convert ergosterol to vitamin d & prevent ergosterol production) without system damage?

	- drug attributes should include:
		- fungistatic
		- fungicidal (cryptococcus)
		- soluble in water & alcohol
		- stressor for kidneys
		- 90% excreted in urine & sweat, 10% metabolized

### III. cancer

	- relevant processes/attributes/systems:
		- communication, stressor distribution, & boundaries
		- immune system 
		- system & process error types

	- treatments should include:
		- anthrax for bladder cancer
		- known cancer drugs

	- treatment strategies should include:
	  	- promote circulation in the organ (like caffeoquinone acid in the liver) to increasee cell communication, or push them to a place with greater blood flow or cell communication
	  	- identity set of stressors to activate helpful cell division
	  	- need a way to detect tumors using existing bio metrics
	  	- isolate tumors with a compound that they will interpret as the boundary of the host so they dont replicate further
	  	- make a list of anti-inflammatories & fit them to the stressor model
	  	- determine which organisms can borrow genes & look for link to cancer
	  	- determine the ratio of stress that optimizes learning without killing the host; ideally the solution would use the extra cell division potential to make useful cells
	  	- make a list of the common types of error the immune system makes (h pylori, cancer) & figure out if adjusting immune system function is the best layer to attack from

## Functions
