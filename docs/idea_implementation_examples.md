# Idea Implementations


## Object Model Applications to Problem Objects


  ### Generate Object Model Interactions

    - how would you generate the useful interfaces/parameters of the object model, if you didnt already know these useful ways to use object/attribute/rule/type definitions?

    - given common functions (combine, fit, relate, distribute) and the set of objects (attribute, type, function, object), you can generate the set of interactions:
      - generate full set of unit shapes possible with functions (network, sequence, tree, layer, etc)
      - combine shapes with all objects (attribute tree, type network, function layer)
      - combine functions with all shapes to get higher shape layers, like system shapes (network tree)
      - combine functions with all objects (change function type, distribute object function, type fitting attribute, fit relation function)

    - then you can identify the useful interactions out of that set using filtering rules:
      - filter by interactions that maximize variance of entities involved
      - filter by interactions that are unitary/simple to get core interactions

    - this process can be applied to other systems

    - another useful process is identifying unique objects & core functions in a system, which should be run before the above object interaction generating process


  ### Interaction Predictions

    - before buying a product, after scanning the objects you own, this tool would be able to tell you how the product might negatively interact with the other objects

    - example: when buying essential oil, it would answer questions like:
      - 'how will this interact with the furniture in my house, if used as directed?' (diffuser)
      - 'how will this interact with the furniture in my house, if used as people use it for alternative purposes than directed' (medical)
      - 'how effective will it be for a particular problem/use case' (this is simulated product testing using object model queries like in the previous section)

    - it would also scan the commonly used & potential use cases for possible intentions with the product
      - 'if youre planning on using it for use case "self-treatment", only take x amount for y period of time if youre otherwise healthy'

    - also generate which attributes coordinate with which rule sets (& their combination output spaces)

      - given a set of rules, you can generate the possible impact of rule combinations in a space with known objects
      - the output space should be usable as an input to derive the set of attributes generated by/emerging from the rules

      - example:

        - given that a chess piece can move according to certain rules & given certain input chess pieces with position, the set of all possible moves is calculatable
        - given the set of all possible moves (and resulting paths), you should be able to calculate emerging attributes of the game of chess
          
          - such as:

            - ratio between optimal paths and possible paths
            - maximum path-limiting potential of a non-final move
            - optimal intent & intent combinations of varying abstraction (diversify, get to opposing end first, guard king)
            - key determining variables (number of pawns sacrificed, number of maximum-square moves, number of nth-hop moves)
            - incentive structures (have backup strategy, calculate limiting activity of moves)
            - number of equivalent alternative paths
            - variance distribution across system
            - variance added by each piece type and each repeated piece of a type
            - variance added by each rule, allocated to a type or across types
            - value added by planning/deriving opponents' plans
            - value added by calculating all options or probable options during game
            - value added by preparing for probable options given opponent experience assessment
            - value added by assumptions (aggressiveness, experience of opponent, strategies not clearly mapped to intent or other system objects)
            - optimal board coverage at different phases
            - function sets needed to beat any opponent
            - variable sensitivity
            - variable substitutability
            - related variables
            - unenforced rules (creating variable spaces) vs. enforced rules
            - types/cause/intent objects
            - potential impact of agent creativity
            - relevant interfaces
            - path metadata topology & navigation methods to get from one state to another

          - abstract attributes (concepts, properties):

            - system attributes:
              - complexity
              - randomness
              - order (moves occur in chains where order matters)
              - types (different types of pieces have different rules)
              - ratio (different ratios of type populations)
              - limits (moves limit the remaining possible moves)

            - game attributes:
              - fairness

    - the matrix of rules/attribute configurations & interactions is an important object for emergent effect/concept & interaction prediction
      - this stores the full set of interactions & variations possible within the type/object definition
      - the variations are representable with a topology
      - the interactions may vary by more than one distance measure, so may require multiple topologies (metric topology of variation topologies)
      - representing the emergent properties may involve networks, paths across the topology & between topologies for emergent properties (like relevant interfaces or potential impact of agent creativity)
      - representing abstract attributes may involve subset topologies (a topology using a subset of vars or another transform like a type/interface/concept transform), networks, paths, layers, cross-sections, circuits & slices for abstract attributes (like power, or balance)
      - abstract attributes can be inputs, outputs, or organization/combination/logic attributes
      - since abstract concepts usually have their own internal network of meanings, the concept itself usually has a field of relevance generated by this network, rather than a clear boundary on its relevance

    - what other networks generate fields?
      - networks with enough variance have fields of potential in addition to the defined objects & functions, since variance accretes & variance potentials collide
      - these fields of potential have multiple types/layers:
        - potential variations of existing system objects (position, spin)
        - potential changes in system rules (switch between change rule sets, type rule sets, boundary rule sets, standard rule sets, or interaction rule sets at different scales, when joined with other molecules to form different-scaled object)
        - potential breakdown/transformation of system (charge rules, change rules)
        - potential interactions with other systems (sharing electrons & other types of combination)
      - the collision & overlap of these fields of potential generates areas of states varying by probability


    - emergent effect prediction:

      - example: 
        - if you bend your knee fast enough that you eventually hit a limit, a reflex will kick in (based on speed if you miscalculate your speed based on the limit) to push you up without effort, retaining some momentum in the process, exerting a synergistic effect with standing up
        - given that the spectrums of variance overlap (vertical motion) between variables (reflex motion & bend motion), you can predict that they will either have synergistic/compounding or neutralizing impact, depending on direction of output force

      - factors of potential for emergent effects
        - alignment between function metadata (intents, variables, variable metadata)
        - boundaries/limits 
        - variance handlers (boundary protection rule - reflex instinct)

    - state/type change point prediction
      - states & types follow patterns in the proportion & distribution of variance across variable sets
        - example: several variables have to be diverging from average in order for a type change to occur, and the output vector & other metadata of these changes will have a point where it becomes clear which type they are leading toward and what probability the transition will continue
      - the change points will be discernible from these patterns & pattern variables
        - the patterns in variables, variable sets, variable values, variable types, variable metadata (importance, dependency network) will be able to predict type change points at various variable configurations


  ### Identifying important semantic objects in a problem space

    - identifying optimal structure, or object identity:
      - exploit opportunities, monster systems/assumptions, risk chains, error & variance cascades/flow, transaction iterations, trade loops

      to understand a particular problem space:
      - markets, function prediction/derivation/reduction, attribute/path optimization, compression, metadata generation (moment-generating function), etc

    - how would you identify those important objects in a system?

      - you can filter combinations by variance & usefulness, like in the "object model generation" example above

        - "type networks" and "variable networks" are particularly useful combinations, for example

      - but this leaves out a method to identify the combinations of combinations with significant variance interactions:

        - such as connecting the following interacting variance rules to identify that (given these variance rules) an exploit opportunity is an important object in the problem space:
          - "agents vary by intention"
          - "intention varies from stated intention"
          - "rules vary from enforcement rules"
          - "implementations vary from implementation rules"
          - "optimal implementation varies from actual implementation"
          - "beneficiaries of a rule optimization efficiency vary by distribution"
          - "agents identifying a rule optimization efficiency first can imbalance the distribution of benefits in their favor"
          - "exploit opportunity"
        - the existence of this object is dependent on whether each rule in the chain holds (if rules are unenforced, if agents vary by intention, etc)

        - examples of objects:
          - rule: a path
          - rule optimization: method to find a path at reduced cost (reduced distance, ie a shorter path)
          - rule optimization efficiency: the shorter path itself, or a pattern in rule optimization methods

      - some of those important objects happen to be interfaces (simplifying standards for comparison)

        - the previous example was generated using the variance interface
        - some interfaces that are also important objects or direct combinations of important objects include:
          - trade loops (closed systems are an implementation of a combination of the boundary/type interface and the structure/loop interface)
          - risk chains are an important object that you could generate using the structure/gap interface, given that risks are uncertainties/info asymmetries
            risk is also an interface itself, so applying it to the structure/chain interface creates the risk chain object

    - core structure components

        - calculatable structures: 
          - dimension: variable
          - layer: parameter determining variance accretion interfaces
          - space: dimension set
          - scale, range, spectrum
          - group: set, potentially across dimensions (cluster of data points)
          - list: set, potentially organized in a dimension (line of points)
          - line: point link
          - center: possible in a shape with symmetries
          - corner: possible in a shape trending toward a circuit or a combination of circuit subsets (multiple lines joined at ends)
          - tensor: vectors with common origin
          - vector: line with restricted metadata (direction & magnitude)
          - eigenvector: vector describing variance metadata (direction)
          - circuit: series of lines moving at angles that allow returning to origin point
          - network: linked points
          - tree: network with direction
          - stack: layers with values (trajectory between points in layers)
          - topology, manifold: permutation set with symmetric properties
          - approximation
          - distance: variance in a similarity measure
          - origin: starting point
          - point: value set of dimensions
          - angle: comparative measure of divergence between paths with same starting point
          - direction: output attribute from input origin given a space-traversal object (line)
          - boundary/edge/limit: extremes of resource combination generative potential
          - inflection: metric change limit (maxima/minima of rate of change)
          - intersection: conflict/overlap
          - tangent: line of least nonzero interactions with another line
          - symmetry, ratio
          - scalar: degree
          - rate: relation of variable to another variable 
            (putting top variable in terms of the bottom variable)
            y/x: putting y in terms of x
            20/4: putting 20 in terms of 4 (to make 20 you need 5 4s)
            number/unit: putting numbers in terms of unit (integers)
            function/combination: putting functions in terms of combinations (inputs/operations/intents)
              (this is an example of interface standardization)
          - cascade/path, chain, sequence, expansion, progression, series
          - distribution

        - properties of calculatable structures:
          - order 
          - balance
          - equivalence
          - similarity
          - accuracy
          - complexity

        - combination/contextual/conceptual structures:
          - unit (isolatable entity)
          - position (point)
          - comparison (rate)
          - combination (group)
          - permutation
          - interface (common attribute or attribute set)
          - trigger
          - trade
          - variance
          - pattern
          - change
          - flow
          - state

        - equivalent, alternate, substitute
        - opposite, inverse

        - shape configurations involve different values of the parameters, which can be core components (number of sides, angle, number type, etc), that accrete into shape types with differentiating derivable/emergent attributes

    - also fitting known structures & known permutations of structures to explain a possible missing object or combination in a system

    - what parameters apply across interfaces? 
      - info, similarity, change, combination, position, structure, concepts, time, other interfaces

    - condition/alternate flow
      - what influences the accidental evolution of alternates, other than symmetries (complexity/intent/resource/stressor alignments)?

    - what are the patterns of stressor demand/change supply matching?
      - this is the same problem as intent (gap)-function matching - the stressor demands that you do something new, and you supply change to handle it
      - look for variable sensitivity (high output change from low input change)
      - distortion patterns of function-finding, function selection, function estimation, function generation (same for function patterns & variables)
      - alternate calculation methods & combinations of inputs/conditions/operations/metrics

    - system operations:
        - emergent intersecting property (momentum, size, shape) interacting with a closed system (cell)
        - closed system components within a host closed system (organelles within cell)
        - closed & open system components within a host closed system
        - system/component boundaries/layers


  ### Object Layer & Interface Identification

    - there may be an optimal layer or other set of objects on one layer or across layers with which to frame a problem

      - when framed in this way, the problem is always solvable 

        - same operation as selecting a host system to represent a problem space, or selecting structures to represent the problem space objects themselves
        https://twitter.com/remixerator/status/1205700297965727749

    - there may be an optimal interface to solve a problem, based on problem type or available resources (info, info-generating, variance-minimization, & other resource types)

      - evaluating solutions for system impact is a key failure point to focus on, to prevent this method from generating same error types as existing methods
      - this means identifying chains of interacting patterns that can produce variance objects (like a black swan or other types of risk chain) & at which times its likely to do so, based on chained interaction times

    - all interactions that are not predicted in a emergent problem or designed solution space are sources of variance (and also may be exploit opportunities), that can convert a solution into a problem, or occasionally produce a solution by coincidentally interacting order & variance (a mutation that generates a function to protect from a pathogen, by trial & error of which mutations survive)

    - designed objects often differ from emergent objects in chaotic ways that produce more variance rather than reduce it, unless design is built on understanding of emergent objects higher up causal chain

    - in a math space, interfaces can take the form of standard unique shape units

    - how would you identify all the interfaces in a space? 
      
      - interfaces: simplifying filters that standardize across most/all objects in a way that highlights their differences for comparison

      - this is a similar problem to identifying symmetries

      - symmetries involve variables that dont change when another variable changes

      - interfaces involve standardization (removal of variables that dont change) to leave the variables that change


## Logic Complexity & System Operations

    - evaluate logic complexity calculations for mapping with core/system operations

      - iteration:

        - applying a process to every item in a set = multiplication/distribution or division/standardization depending on the operation (dimension reduction/expansion)

      - conditions:

        - conditions map to branches/divergence (like type-splitting & hub nodes)

        - value added by conditions must be weighed against conditional logic isolation

        - condition order varies by dependency; some conditions must be in a certain order, some condition orders are more flexible, some conditions in a set have no order restrictions (can be in any order)

        - condition ordering rules:
          - conditions likeliest to be false come first
          - conditions verifying prerequisites/inputs to other conditions come first

      - layers:

        - embedded for loop = multiplication/distribution, but also has concept of embedding (related to system and its sub-components)

        - embedded conditions = hierarchy or route


  ### Identifying useful object combinations

    - combine risk, cause, variance, and probability objects (uncertainty, causal loop, variance generator, probability distribution)

    - combine structural & conceptual objects (vector + priority)

    - what is the set of interface objects optimal for solving a problem of particular dimension (x, y, z) & shape a?


  ### Problem Type Prediction for a System

    - given a system structure, which problem types are likely to occur?

    - problem types:

      - conflicts

        - interaction objects
          - inputs/requirements/logic/incentives/assumptions/patterns/types/priorities/exploits/interfaces

        - types

          - mismatch 
            - incorrect position/structure/rule/direction
              - example: receptor fits the correct protein but also a hostile protein because its shape is too general (a conflict of mismatched scope)

          - competition (forces pulling in different directions, limited resources)

          - opposition (neutralizing functions)
            - misaligned incentives 
              - example: monitoring function not given reason to monitor the lib building the monitoring function

        - resolution configurations
            - one competitor winning & replacing the other
            - compromise:
              - sharing (sharing the resource)
              - delegation (cooperating to acquire the resource)
              - differentiation (developing different ways to get the resource, such as producing it themselves)
              - agent adaptation (changing what is demanded/prioritized so conflict is invalid)
            - forfeit
            - game adaptation 
            - variance overrides (new universal enemy aligns incentives of competitors to cooperate)

      - asymmetries

        - can be framed as a conflict/mismatch between supply & demand
        - resource asymmetries (misallocated info, cause, power, variance)
        - includes questions and other inequalities
        - emergent patterns created by imbalances in usage patterns

        - example asymmetries with different params:
          - asymmetry of info (distance between info sources, such as agents specialized for a particular function needing different information)
          - asymmetry of info across time (prediction, convergence of info sources)

        - symmetries as epicenters/organizers/distributers/filters of similarity/variance
          - limits as an output of symmetries - can you calculate all symmetries, and can you calculate all limits from the set of symmetries?
          - how do symmetries evolve in a system - do they provide a standard/interface for variance to coordinate efficiently?
          - how are symmetries related to efficiency?
          - quantum entanglement occurs around symmetries & other aggregators like similarity

        - resolution configurations
          - removing resource
          - balancing resource
          - replacing resource
          - deriving & distributing resource generator
          - variance/conflict injection

      - variance injections

        - unrestricted inputs (incentive/intent/expectation gaps)
        - unhandled error types

        - resolution configurations
          - adding barrier/filter to variance source
          - distributing variance to minimize impact (distributing stressor across surface area)
          - breaking variance into subsets that match existing variance handlers
          - combining variance handlers to match variance source
          - combining variance sources to match variance handlers

      - what problems are not solvable?

        - in the universe, if you deployed a perfect computer to every smallest unit of matter/energy/info, what could you not compute?
          - for example, you couldnt compute the optimal combinations of all the other units in each unit, because the computation would involve observing other units in a way that might require them to do no processing while being observed, and this might prevent the computation from being completed by each unit of matter containing a computation device, such as a superposition
        - are there systems in which that problem is solvable (if you adjusted variance cascade patterns, could the uncertainty be reduced enough for it to be solvable)
        - solvable: can be generated by a set of identifiable factors
        - what is solvable is limited by what is identifiable - when identifying tools change, how does solvability change?


  ### Problem Source Identification

    1. example: 

        - if a bottle containing juice is the only thing someone drinks regularly and it makes them sick, how do you figure out that it's most probably bc of a chemical on the inner lining of the bottle, programmatically - ranking less probable causes as well

        - query object definitions involved (bottle, juice, person) and relationships involved (containing, drinking)

        - query attributes of objects that interact (with output: bottle lining-juice, bottle cap-juice, manufacturing machinery-juice, juice-person, etc)

        - query known strategies of implementation - with output:
          - 'aligned supply and demand may not match in quantity, quality, or timing'
          - 'goods are often not purchased immediately because supply and demand matching is imperfect as information is often unavailable'
          - 'to protect goods while waiting for purchase, chemicals are used'
          - 'to find protective chemicals, companies do research'
          - 'interim sub-optimal solutions are often used while waiting for optimal solutions'
          - 'companies often use easiest chemical to find, which are often within a set range of permutations away from or combinations of common chemicals'
          - 'a company usually finds an optimal solution before the sub-optimal units are purchased'
          - 'if a company finds an optimal solution, they often still try to sell the remaining supply of the sub-optimal solution'
          - 'usually the company produces x batches before they find a better solution, if they integrate customer feedback and use third party evaluators'

        - query causes of that illness (medication, nausea, food poisoning)

        - eliminate unlikely causes using filtering rules, for efficiency (reverse later if none found among likely rules)
          - 'regular use of a product can produce sustained or compounding impact'
          - 'toxic chemicals are more likely to be used by large companies with ties to legislators'
          - 'ingesting chemicals is x times more toxic than breathing or touching chemicals'
          - 'the industry producing this product has x lawsuits/reports and z oversight relative to other industries'
          - 'the industry producing this product has a regulation loophole x that would allow exploit y'
          - 'this company's business model doesnt incentivize quality control at the source level'

        - after scanning all the objects someone interacts with regularly, this set of interactions should be able to identify the bottle lining as the problem

        - if no problem source is found among their current objects, their purchase history & that of those they interact with can be scanned for prior exposure or dietary causes


    2. example:

        - "They measured performance in two southern Californian classrooms—one with big windows, one with small windows—and found that the kids with the bigger windows fared better, confirming [the researchers'] beliefs. But when they repeated the experiment in northern California, where it's cooler, big windows made no difference. It turned out that daylight didn't play a role in performance, but fresh air did—the classes in warmer southern California had their windows open."

        1. Problem definition

          - problem type: "info asymmetry"

            - problem type metadata:

              - problem subtype:
                - "different outcomes for same action, where one outcome was successful, but not for difference hypothesized (sunlight)"

              - missing info (question), given the info asymmetry problem type:
                - hypothesis: "sunlight improves performance"
                - question: "which factors determine performance differences between rooms in different locations"
                  (given the implication of study, which is that "sunlight doesnt appear to improve performance on its own")

              - explicit info:
                - objects:
                  - windows
                  - rooms
                  - locations
                  - performance test
                  - sunlight
                  - test takers

              - retrievable info:
                - differences between locations:
                  - pollution exposure
                  - weather patterns (temperature)
                - definitions of objects, including intents

              - derivable info:
                - whether known interactions between objects can explain the metric difference, or if additional data is required
              
            - rules:

              - inputs:

                assumptions:
                  - "environment impacts performance"
                  - "sunlight impacts performance"

                observations:
                - rules in terms of hypothesis objects (assumption: "sunlight is relevant/explanatory"):
                  "performance metric increased with more sunlight in south rooms with big windows"
                  "performance metric did not increase with more sunlight in north rooms with big windows"
                - rules in terms with hypothesis objects removed (removes assumption that "sunlight is relevant/explanatory"):
                  "performance metric increased with more sunlight in south rooms with big windows"
                  "performance metric did not increase with more sunlight in north rooms with big windows"

              - outputs:

                interpretations:
                  - "location impacts performance"
                    - someone might expect different performance based on location alone, if school districts have different funding or nearby pollution sources
                    - however location isnt assumed as a causative factor but rather an interface with which to isolate the variables to be studied (sunlight)

                implications:
                  - "sunlight doesnt appear to improve performance on its own"

                contra-implications:
                  - "this doesnt mean sunlight isnt a factor at all"


          2. Relationship-finding vectors

            - iterate through object attributes/rules/types, evaluating them for possible distortions/states or other values that could definitively occur or possibly emerge naturally

              - window:
                - window object is a tool with multiple values for its position attribute: open/closed
                - window.position is a tool to serve various intents:
                  - temperature regulation
                  - pollution protection
                  - air dissipation
                  - wind route manipulation
                  - alternate to air conditioning systems

              - location:
                - location object is a place type with key differences in various attributes, like weather, ecology, population & industry
                - location.weather attribute differs in temperature attribute values
                  *** 
                  this should be flagged as a particularly interesting possible relationship, 
                    because it relates to attributes/rules of other objects already identified 
                    (window as tool of temperature regulation)
                  ***

              - room:
                - room object has an intent attribute with multiple values: "focus", "removal of distractions", "work alignment", "performance test"

              - student:
                - student object has multiple intents: 
                  - "maintain optimal conditions for focus"
                  - "maintain focus so you can remember information you studied"

              - "conditions" objects involved in student object intents should be flagged as a source of variance that can interact with other objects, which are environmental, and therefore it should be queried
              
              - condition:
                - condition objects with output intent "focus" include: "caffeine", "water supply", "electrolyte balance", "sleep", "quiet", "temperature regulation"
                  ***
                  temperature regulation should be flagged as particularly relevant, and store the possible relationship:
                    student.intents for metric "test performance" includes "maintain focus conditions"
                    conditions where intent = "focus" includes "temperature regulation"
                  ***

            - after iterating, you should have a list of the relevant object definitions (including intents, types, rules, alternate values, etc)

            - you should also now have the important attributes/rules with possible relationships, organized by their common factors, which may be sources of relevance:

              - temperature relationships:

                - window.position can be determined by temperature regulation intent
                - location differs by temperature in weather patterns
                - student.intents for activity = "test-taking" includes "maintain focus conditions"
                - conditions where intent = "focus" includes "temperature regulation"

          3. Standardize variables by relationship metadata (directness, variance maximization, uncertainty)

            - given that you have at least one relevance factor to explore, standardize the relationships:

              - its determinable that the key potential sources of variance are:
                - naturally-determined environment conditions (location.weather)
                - artificially-determined focus conditions (window.position, room.temperature)

              - logical variable reduction:

                - origin relationship:
                  location => weather => room => window => student => focus conditions => performance

                - you can remove the student object from the analysis, because we mainly care if the room & location.weather & window.position impact the focus conditions required for performance:
                  location => weather => room => window => focus conditions => performance

                - you can also remove the environment objects from the analysis, because we mainly care about the resulting variable attributes that could interact with focus conditions, leaving only the temperature attribute to link the weather, location, window, and focus conditions, since window, location & weather can be collapsed to variable attributes: sunlight & temperature

                  - temperature || sunlight => focus conditions => performance

                - you can further collapse the focus & performance into one variable:

                  - temperature || sunlight => focus conditions

                  - the reason we wouldnt choose to leave in performance over focus conditions is:
                    - focus conditions have a known direct link to performance (if its known, it shouldnt be included in data set, which should maximize variance)
                    - temperature & sunlight may have a direct link to focus conditions, and this direct link is measurable through attribute interactions
                    - the relationship between temperature & sunlight and performance is unknown and may not be explainable by this causal chain, but we're trying to explain it by proxy, through measuring the theorized relationship between temperature & sunlight and focus conditions, given that focus conditions are a key input of performance
                    - performance for a set of focus conditions can be checked after the temperature & sunlight => focus conditions relationship is established, since the focus conditions => performance relationship is known (or at least better understood)

                - out of the resulting reduced hypothesized relationship:
                  "temperature || sunlight => focus conditions"

                  we are determining if temperature or sunlight is the greater determining factor
                  (in this particular iteration of variable alts - excluding other variables like motivation/preparation and other temperature variable alts like air conditioning access, etc)
                  
                  - implicit causal shape assumptions:
                    - we are assuming they dont both influence performance
                    - we are also ignoring the small correlation between temperature & sunlight (cloudy days & nights can be hot, but sunlight is associated with higher temperature overall)
                    - we are checking for an isolated direct one-directional relationship, not a causal network or loop

                - you can also reduce alternate variable values explored to focus on those directly impacted by hypothesis objects

                  - leaving out alternate focus conditions that arent directly impacted by temperature like caffeine & quiet, 
                    although these arent entirely unrelated as caffeine may increase body temperature 
                    & a noisy environment may mean people are talking/moving more & that may increase room temperature

                  - in this study we're looking for direct relationships (causal adjacency) rather than indirect relationships
                
                - so if you use a semantic logic iteration through related object attributes, you only have to iterate through objects: location.weather, window.position, focus conditions
                - if you use a alternate state variable network, you only have to iterate through objects: temperature, sunlight, focus conditions


              - if variables have similar variability or have common transformations explaining their variability (like taking one variable to the power of another variable)
                check if removing them alters output, otherwise they may be directly related rather than independent

              - selecting the key output variable:

                - collapse variable links with known mappings (focus conditions & performance => focus conditions)

                - collapse variables having common output attribute into standard interface of that output attribute (window, room, location => temperature)

                - dont collapse variables being studied as alternatives (keep sunlight & temperature separate, given that we are assuming one or the other is determinant)

                - it can also be determined in other ways that the key output object is "focus conditions"

                - apply dependency analysis:

                  - without the right focus conditions, the impact of "location => weather => window => room => student" relationship doesnt matter because "student => brain => focus => pass test" relationship is not executable without focus conditions in place
                  - this can be determined by inputs of the "test object", where performance is known to be heavily influenced by focus conditions
                  - this means you can approach this problem from the reverse direction, iterating through focus conditions first & the impact of each variable & relationship on each condition

              - selection key attributes providing interface to evaluate impact on output variable:

                - how could you automate the selection of the key attributes (sunlight, temperature) providing the best interface for comparison to evaluate impact on the output variable?


          4. Select & apply method of reducing possible relationships

            I. Method: Semantic logic iteration through related object attributes identified by relationship-finding vectors

              - iterate through those relationships for each relevance factor (temperature)

              - what order do you iterate through relationships for a relevance factor in?
                - you can start with objects having known differentiating factors 
                  (different locations were chosen for a reason, and the window is an important object in the hypothesis even with assumptions removed)

                - you can also approach from other known relationships, such as that performance is heavily influenced by focus conditions,
                  in which case youd iterate through focus conditions, and check which alternate states of the other objects could impact each focus condition

              - since location differs between samples:

                check if window.position can differ:
                if so, alternate window.position across locations:
                  check if alternate window.position achieves student.intents aligning with location object metadata: does opening the window achieve anything in south vs. north room?

                  iterate through possible intents of different window positions (temperature regulation, pollution protection, air dissipation, etc)
                  for each intent of window.position:

                    check if output intents of intent would differ across locations: would open windows have different output intents in north & south rooms?
                    yes, because of difference in weather patterns:
                      output intent of open window in hot south room = hot - hot = cool = "temperature regulation"
                      output intent of open window in cool north room = no difference in temperature regulation = cool - cool = "no temperature regulation"

                      given that window.position can serve intent "temperature regulation" across locations & temperature is the key relevance factor for this relationship set,
                      check if the different output intents have different impact on other possible relationships under 'temperature':

                      iterate through all remaining temperature relationships (if there are a lot, select for relationships involving known important factors like focus conditions first):

                          does output intent "temperature regulation" influence student.intents or condition.intents?

                          yes, it serves the students' "maintain focus conditions" intent, which is served by conditions with "temperature regulation" intent
                            (we could reduce this to just analyzing the condition.intent, since the student is aligned with this intent & doesnt add variance for the purposes of this study)

                            now that youve identified theres a logical flow between all relationships of a relevance factor (temperature), 
                            check if the implications of this logical flow match the observed rules:

                              implications for relevant variable variants (vary temperature):
                                - if room is in higher-temperature location, window can be opened to reduce temperature, which is a focus condition intent required by students' test-taking intents

                              does this match the observed rules:

                                - yes, this explains why the two locations had different outcomes for the same action - locations vary by temperature
                                  - output new theory: "temperature determines performance differences because focus conditions require temperature regulation, which is enabled by window.position changes in high-temperature locations"

                                - no, continue iteration

            II. Alternate state variable network

              - you can also generate a network of alternate variable values among variables suspected to be relevant & check for output intents, 
                rather than narrowing down relationship sets with semantic logic conditions between objects like variables & intents

                - what are the output intents of the vectors: 

                  [window = open, location = north, weather = storm, sunlight = low, quiet = low]
                    - output intent: "contradicts focus conditions = 'quiet'"

                  [window = closed, location = north, weather = hot, sunlight = high, caffeine = high, sleep = low]
                    - output intent: "contradicts focus conditions = 'sleep', 'temperature regulation'"

                  [window = open, location = south, weather = hot, sunlight = high, caffeine = high]
                    - output intent: "serves focus conditions = 'caffeine', 'temperature regulation'"

                - now you can answer the question:
                    - "which of these vectors serve/maximize the key variable 'focus conditions'?"

              - visuals to visualize a alternate variable state network:
                - you can assign a radius to each variable, where possible variable values have different positions on the resulting variable circle
                - the output intents would be outside the last variable circle, and would have an attribute (color/direction) indicating output intent value:
                  (negative, neutral, positive impact on focus conditions)
                - the goal is to arrange & navigate the variable circles toward the target output intent to optimize some metric (least number of steps, most independent variables, etc)

              - if you pick the right starting variable for the vector's first item, you can reduce the trajectories required in your network of possible variable value combinations
              
              - radiate outward from origin variable node by assigning vector position by variability (high variance attributes come first in vector determining output path in network)

              - 

      - uses insight path technology


  ### Definition differentiation

    - given that most conceptual objects are related, how do you identify which are most important in determining another object?
    - identify that "intent" is highly related to "priority"
    - identify that "insight" is highly related to "strategy"
    - identify that "role" is highly related to "function"
