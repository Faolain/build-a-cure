# Idea Implementations


## Object Model Applications to Problem Objects


  ### Generate Object Model Interactions

    - how would you generate the useful interfaces/parameters of the object model, if you didnt already know these useful ways to use object/attribute/rule/type definitions?

    - given common functions (combine, fit, relate, distribute) and the set of objects (attribute, type, function, object), you can generate the set of interactions:
      - generate full set of unit shapes possible with functions (network, sequence, tree, layer, etc)
      - combine shapes with all objects (attribute tree, type network, function layer)
      - combine functions with all shapes to get higher shape layers, like system shapes (network tree)
      - combine functions with all objects (change function type, distribute object function, type fitting attribute, fit relation function)

    - then you can identify the useful interactions out of that set using filtering rules:
      - filter by interactions that maximize variance of entities involved
      - filter by interactions that are unitary/simple to get core interactions

    - this process can be applied to other systems

    - another useful process is identifying unique objects & core functions in a system, which should be run before the above object interaction generating process


  ### Interaction Predictions

    - before buying a product, after scanning the objects you own, this tool would be able to tell you how the product might negatively interact with the other objects

    - example: when buying essential oil, it would answer questions like:
      - 'how will this interact with the furniture in my house, if used as directed?' (diffuser)
      - 'how will this interact with the furniture in my house, if used as people use it for alternative purposes than directed' (medical)
      - 'how effective will it be for a particular problem/use case' (this is simulated product testing using object model queries like in the previous section)

    - it would also scan the commonly used & potential use cases for possible intentions with the product
      - 'if youre planning on using it for use case "self-treatment", only take x amount for y period of time if youre otherwise healthy'

    - also generate which attributes coordinate with which rule sets (& their combination output spaces)

      - given a set of rules, you can generate the possible impact of rule combinations in a space with known objects
      - the output space should be usable as an input to derive the set of attributes generated by/emerging from the rules

      - example:

        - given that a chess piece can move according to certain rules & given certain input chess pieces with position, the set of all possible moves is calculatable
        - given the set of all possible moves (and resulting paths), you should be able to calculate emerging attributes of the game of chess
          
          - such as:

            - ratio between optimal paths and possible paths
            - maximum path-limiting potential of a non-final move
            - optimal intent & intent combinations of varying abstraction (diversify, get to opposing end first, guard king)
            - key determining variables (number of pawns sacrificed, number of maximum-square moves, number of nth-hop moves)
            - incentive structures (have backup strategy, calculate limiting activity of moves)
            - number of equivalent alternative paths
            - variance distribution across system
            - variance added by each piece type and each repeated piece of a type
            - variance added by each rule, allocated to a type or across types
            - value added by planning/deriving opponents' plans
            - value added by calculating all options or probable options during game
            - value added by preparing for probable options given opponent experience assessment
            - value added by assumptions (aggressiveness, experience of opponent, strategies not clearly mapped to intent or other system objects)
            - optimal board coverage at different phases
            - function sets needed to beat any opponent
            - variable sensitivity
            - variable substitutability
            - related variables
            - unenforced rules (creating variable spaces) vs. enforced rules
            - types/cause/intent objects
            - potential impact of agent creativity
            - relevant interfaces
            - path metadata topology & navigation methods to get from one state to another

          - abstract attributes:

            - system attributes:
              - complexity
              - randomness

            - game attributes:
              - fairness

  ### Identifying important semantic objects in a problem space

    - identifying optimal structure, or object identity:
      - exploit opportunities, monster systems/assumptions, risk chains, error & variance cascades/flow, transaction iterations, trade loops

      to understand a particular problem space:
      - markets, function prediction/derivation/reduction, attribute/path optimization, compression, metadata generation (moment-generating function), etc

    - how would you identify those important objects in a system?

      - you can filter combinations by variance & usefulness, like in the "object model generation" example above

        - "type networks" and "variable networks" are particularly useful combinations, for example

      - but this leaves out a method to identify the combinations of combinations with significant variance interactions:

        - such as connecting the following interacting variance rules to identify that (given these variance rules) an exploit opportunity is an important object in the problem space:
          - "agents vary by intention"
          - "intention varies from stated intention"
          - "rules vary from enforcement rules"
          - "implementations vary from implementation rules"
          - "optimal implementation varies from actual implementation"
          - "beneficiaries of a rule optimization efficiency vary by distribution"
          - "agents identifying a rule optimization efficiency first can imbalance the distribution of benefits in their favor"
          - "exploit opportunity"
        - the existence of this object is dependent on whether each rule in the chain holds (if rules are unenforced, if agents vary by intention, etc)

        - examples of objects:
          - rule: a path
          - rule optimization: method to find a path at reduced cost (reduced distance, ie a shorter path)
          - rule optimization efficiency: the shorter path itself, or a pattern in rule optimization methods

      - some of those important objects happen to be interfaces (simplifying standards for comparison)

        - the previous example was generated using the variance interface
        - some interfaces that are also important objects or direct combinations of important objects include:
          - trade loops (closed systems are an implementation of a combination of the boundary/type interface and the structure/loop interface)
          - risk chains are an important object that you could generate using the structure/gap interface, given that risks are uncertainties/info asymmetries
            risk is also an interface itself, so applying it to the structure/chain interface creates the risk chain object

    - core structure components

        - calculatable structures: 
          - dimension: variable
          - layer: parameter determining variance accretion interfaces
          - space: dimension set
          - scale, range, spectrum
          - group: set, potentially across dimensions (cluster of data points)
          - list: set, potentially organized in a dimension (line of points)
          - line: point link
          - center: possible in a shape with symmetries
          - corner: possible in a shape trending toward a circuit or a combination of circuit subsets (multiple lines joined at ends)
          - tensor: vectors with common origin
          - vector: line with restricted metadata (direction & magnitude)
          - eigenvector: vector describing variance metadata (direction)
          - circuit: series of lines moving at angles that allow returning to origin point
          - network: linked points
          - tree: network with direction
          - stack: layers with values (trajectory between points in layers)
          - topology, manifold: permutation set with symmetric properties
          - approximation
          - distance: variance in a similarity measure
          - origin: starting point
          - point: value set of dimensions
          - angle: comparative measure of divergence between paths with same starting point
          - direction: output attribute from input origin given a space-traversal object (line)
          - boundary/edge/limit: extremes of resource combination generative potential
          - inflection: metric change limit (maxima/minima of rate of change)
          - intersection: conflict/overlap
          - tangent: line of least nonzero interactions with another line
          - symmetry, ratio
          - scalar: degree
          - rate: relation of variable to another variable 
            (putting top variable in terms of the bottom variable)
            y/x: putting y in terms of x
            20/4: putting 20 in terms of 4 (to make 20 you need 5 4s)
            number/unit: putting numbers in terms of unit (integers)
            function/combination: putting functions in terms of combinations (inputs/operations/intents)
              (this is an example of interface standardization)
          - cascade/path, chain, sequence, expansion, progression, series
          - distribution

        - properties of calculatable structures:
          - order 
          - balance
          - equivalence
          - similarity
          - accuracy
          - complexity

        - combination/contextual/conceptual structures:
          - unit (isolatable entity)
          - position (point)
          - comparison (rate)
          - combination (group)
          - permutation
          - interface (common attribute or attribute set)
          - trigger
          - trade
          - variance
          - pattern
          - change
          - flow
          - state

        - equivalent, alternate, substitute
        - opposite, inverse

        - shape configurations involve different values of the parameters, which can be core components (number of sides, angle, number type, etc), that accrete into shape types with differentiating derivable/emergent attributes

    - also fitting known structures & known permutations of structures to explain a possible missing object or combination in a system

    - what parameters apply across interfaces? 
      - info, similarity, change, combination, position, structure, concepts, time, other interfaces

    - condition/alternate flow
      - what influences the accidental evolution of alternates, other than symmetries (complexity/intent/resource/stressor alignments)?

    - what are the patterns of stressor demand/change supply matching?
      - this is the same problem as intent (gap)-function matching - the stressor demands that you do something new, and you supply change to handle it
      - look for variable sensitivity (high output change from low input change)
      - distortion patterns of function-finding, function selection, function estimation, function generation (same for function patterns & variables)
      - alternate calculation methods & combinations of inputs/conditions/operations/metrics

    - system operations:
        - emergent intersecting property (momentum, size, shape) interacting with a closed system (cell)
        - closed system components within a host closed system (organelles within cell)
        - closed & open system components within a host closed system
        - system/component boundaries/layers

  ### Object Layer & Interface Identification

    - there may be an optimal layer or other set of objects on one layer or across layers with which to frame a problem
      - when framed in this way, the problem is always solvable 
        (same operation as selecting a host system to represent a problem space, or selecting structures to represent the problem space objects themselves)
      https://twitter.com/remixerator/status/1205700297965727749

    - there may be an optimal interface to solve a problem, based on problem type or available resources (info, info-generating, variance-minimization, & other resource types)

      - evaluating solutions for system impact is a key failure point to focus on, to prevent this method from generating same error types as existing methods
      - this means identifying chains of interacting patterns that can produce variance objects (like a black swan or other types of risk chain) & at which times its likely to do so, based on chained interaction times

    - all interactions that are not predicted in a emergent problem or designed solution space are sources of variance (and also may be exploit opportunities), that can convert a solution into a problem, or occasionally produce a solution by coincidentally interacting order & variance (a mutation that generates a function to protect from a pathogen, by trial & error of which mutations survive)

    - designed objects often differ from emergent objects in chaotic ways that produce more variance rather than reduce it, unless design is built on understanding of emergent objects higher up causal chain

    - in a math space, interfaces can take the form of standard unique shape units

    - how would you identify all the interfaces in a space? 
      
      - interfaces: simplifying filters that standardize across most/all objects in a way that highlights their differences for comparison

      - this is a similar problem to identifying symmetries

      - symmetries involve variables that dont change when another variable changes

      - interfaces involve standardization (removal of variables that dont change) to leave the variables that change


  ### Identifying useful object combinations

    - combine risk, cause, variance, and probability objects (uncertainty, causal loop, variance generator, probability distribution)

    - combine structural & conceptual objects (vector + priority)

    - what is the set of interface objects optimal for solving a problem of particular dimension (x, y, z) & shape a?


  ### Problem Type Prediction for a System

    - given a system structure, which problem types are likely to occur?

    - problem types:

      - conflicts

        - interaction objects
          - inputs/requirements/logic/incentives/assumptions/patterns/types/priorities/exploits/interfaces

        - types

          - mismatch 
            - incorrect position/structure/rule/direction
              - example: receptor fits the correct protein but also a hostile protein because its shape is too general (a conflict of mismatched scope)

          - competition (forces pulling in different directions, limited resources)

          - opposition (neutralizing functions)
            - misaligned incentives 
              - example: monitoring function not given reason to monitor the lib building the monitoring function

        - resolution configurations
            - one competitor winning & replacing the other
            - compromise:
              - sharing (sharing the resource)
              - delegation (cooperating to acquire the resource)
              - differentiation (developing different ways to get the resource, such as producing it themselves)
              - agent adaptation (changing what is demanded/prioritized so conflict is invalid)
            - forfeit
            - game adaptation 
            - variance overrides (new universal enemy aligns incentives of competitors to cooperate)

      - asymmetries

        - can be framed as a conflict/mismatch between supply & demand
        - resource asymmetries (misallocated info, cause, power, variance)
        - includes questions and other inequalities
        - emergent patterns created by imbalances in usage patterns

        - example asymmetries with different params:
          - asymmetry of info (distance between info sources, such as agents specialized for a particular function needing different information)
          - asymmetry of info across time (prediction, convergence of info sources)

        - symmetries as epicenters/organizers/distributers/filters of similarity/variance
          - limits as an output of symmetries - can you calculate all symmetries, and can you calculate all limits from the set of symmetries?
          - how do symmetries evolve in a system - do they provide a standard/interface for variance to coordinate efficiently?
          - how are symmetries related to efficiency?
          - quantum entanglement occurs around symmetries & other aggregators like similarity

        - resolution configurations
          - removing resource
          - balancing resource
          - replacing resource
          - deriving & distributing resource generator
          - variance/conflict injection

      - variance injections

        - unrestricted inputs (incentive/intent/expectation gaps)
        - unhandled error types

        - resolution configurations
          - adding barrier/filter to variance source
          - distributing variance to minimize impact (distributing stressor across surface area)
          - breaking variance into subsets that match existing variance handlers
          - combining variance handlers to match variance source
          - combining variance sources to match variance handlers

      - what problems are not solvable?

        - in the universe, if you deployed a perfect computer to every smallest unit of matter/energy/info, what could you not compute?
          - for example, you couldnt compute the optimal combinations of all the other units in each unit, because the computation would involve observing other units in a way that might require them to do no processing while being observed, and this might prevent the computation from being completed by each unit of matter containing a computation device, such as a superposition
        - are there systems in which that problem is solvable (if you adjusted variance cascade patterns, could the uncertainty be reduced enough for it to be solvable)
        - solvable: can be generated by a set of identifiable factors
        - what is solvable is limited by what is identifiable - when identifying tools change, how does solvability change?


  ### Problem Source Identification

    - example: if a bottle containing juice is the only thing someone drinks regularly and it makes them sick, how do you figure out that it's most probably bc of a chemical on the inner lining of the bottle, programmatically - ranking less probable causes as well

      - query object definitions involved (bottle, juice, person) and relationships involved (containing, drinking)

      - query attributes of objects that interact (with output: bottle lining-juice, bottle cap-juice, manufacturing machinery-juice, juice-person, etc)

      - query known strategies of implementation - with output:
        - 'aligned supply and demand may not match in quantity, quality, or timing'
        - 'goods are often not purchased immediately because supply and demand matching is imperfect as information is often unavailable'
        - 'to protect goods while waiting for purchase, chemicals are used'
        - 'to find protective chemicals, companies do research'
        - 'interim sub-optimal solutions are often used while waiting for optimal solutions'
        - 'companies often use easiest chemical to find, which are often within a set range of permutations away from or combinations of common chemicals'
        - 'a company usually finds an optimal solution before the sub-optimal units are purchased'
        - 'if a company finds an optimal solution, they often still try to sell the remaining supply of the sub-optimal solution'
        - 'usually the company produces x batches before they find a better solution, if they integrate customer feedback and use third party evaluators'

      - query causes of that illness (medication, nausea, food poisoning)

      - eliminate unlikely causes using filtering rules, for efficiency (reverse later if none found among likely rules)
        - 'regular use of a product can produce sustained or compounding impact'
        - 'toxic chemicals are more likely to be used by large companies with ties to legislators'
        - 'ingesting chemicals is x times more toxic than breathing or touching chemicals'
        - 'the industry producing this product has x lawsuits/reports and z oversight relative to other industries'
        - 'the industry producing this product has a regulation loophole x that would allow exploit y'
        - 'this company's business model doesnt incentivize quality control at the source level'

      - after scanning all the objects someone interacts with regularly, this set of interactions should be able to identify the bottle lining as the problem

      - if no problem source is found among their current objects, their purchase history & that of those they interact with can be scanned for prior exposure or dietary causes

      - uses insight path technology


  ### Definition differentiation

    - given that most conceptual objects are related, how do you identify which are most important in determining another object?
    - identify that "intent" is highly related to "priority"
    - identify that "insight" is highly related to "strategy"
    - identify that "role" is highly related to "function"
