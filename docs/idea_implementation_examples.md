## Object Model Applications to Problem Objects

  ### Problem Type Prediction for a System

    - given a system structure, which problem types are likely to occur?

    - problem types:

      - conflicts
        - conflicting inputs/requirements/logic/incentives/assumptions

      - asymmetries
        - resource asymmetries (misallocated info, cause, power, variance)
        - emergent patterns created by imbalances in usage patterns
        - symmetries as epicenters/organizers/distributers/filters of similarity/variance
        - limits as an output of symmetries - can you calculate all symmetries, and can you calculate all limits from the set of symmetries?
        - how do symmetries evolve in a system - do they provide a standard/interface for variance to coordinate efficiently?
        - how are symmetries related to efficiency?
        - quantum entanglement occurs around symmetries & other aggregators like similarity

      - variance injections
        - unrestricted inputs
        - unhandled error types

      - misaligned incentives 
        - (monitoring function not given reason to check lib building monitoring function)

      - incorrect position/structure/rule/direction

      - what problems are not solvable?

        - in the universe, if you deployed a perfect computer to every smallest unit of matter/energy/info, what could you not compute?
          - for example, you couldnt compute the optimal combinations of all the other units in each unit, because the computation would involve observing other units in a way that might require them to do no processing while being observed, and this might prevent the computation from being completed by each unit of matter containing a computation device, such as a superposition

  ### Problem Source Identification

    - example: if a bottle containing juice is the only thing someone drinks regularly and it makes them sick, how do you figure out that it's most probably bc of a chemical on the inner lining of the bottle, programmatically - ranking less probable causes as well

      - query object definitions involved (bottle, juice, person) and relationships involved (containing, drinking)

      - query attributes of objects that interact (with output: bottle lining-juice, bottle cap-juice, manufacturing machinery-juice, juice-person, etc)

      - query known strategies of implementation - with output:
        - 'aligned supply and demand may not match in quantity, quality, or timing'
        - 'goods are often not purchased immediately because supply and demand matching is imperfect as information is often unavailable'
        - 'to protect goods while waiting for purchase, chemicals are used'
        - 'to find protective chemicals, companies do research'
        - 'interim sub-optimal solutions are often used while waiting for optimal solutions'
        - 'companies often use easiest chemical to find, which are often within a set range of permutations away from or combinations of common chemicals'
        - 'a company usually finds an optimal solution before the sub-optimal units are purchased'
        - 'if a company finds an optimal solution, they often still try to sell the remaining supply of the sub-optimal solution'
        - 'usually the company produces x batches before they find a better solution, if they integrate customer feedback and use third party evaluators'

      - query causes of that illness (medication, nausea, food poisoning)

      - eliminate unlikely causes using filtering rules, for efficiency (reverse later if none found among likely rules)
        - 'regular use of a product can produce sustained or compounding impact'
        - 'toxic chemicals are more likely to be used by large companies with ties to legislators'
        - 'ingesting chemicals is x times more toxic than breathing or touching chemicals'
        - 'the industry producing this product has x lawsuits/reports and z oversight relative to other industries'
        - 'the industry producing this product has a regulation loophole x that would allow exploit y'
        - 'this company's business model doesnt incentivize quality control at the source level'

      - after scanning all the objects someone interacts with regularly, this set of interactions should be able to identify the bottle lining as the problem

      - if no problem source is found among their current objects, their purchase history & that of those they interact with can be scanned for prior exposure or dietary causes

      - uses insight path technology


  ### Interaction Predictions

    - before buying a product, after scanning the objects you own, this tool would be able to tell you how the product might negatively interact with the other objects
    - example: when buying essential oil, it would answer questions like:
      - 'how will this interact with the furniture in my house, if used as directed?' (diffuser)
      - 'how will this interact with the furniture in my house, if used as people use it for alternative purposes than directed' (medical)
      - 'how effective will it be for a particular problem/use case' (this is simulated product testing using object model queries like in the previous section)
    - it would also scan the commonly used & potential use cases for possible intentions with the product
      - 'if youre planning on using it for use case "self-treatment", only take x amount for y period of time if youre otherwise healthy'


  ### Identifying important semantic objects in a problem space

    - example: identifying optimal structure, or object identity (exploit opportunities, monster systems/assumptions, risk chains, trade loops, variance cascades/flow, transaction iterations) to understand a particular problem space (markets, function prediction/derivation/reduction, attribute/path optimization, compression, metadata generation (moment-generating function), etc)

    - core structure components

        - stack, line, tree, tensor, vector, network, circuit, group, list, unit, interface, combination, permutation, topology, corner, origin, scale, range, spectrum, cascade, trigger, chain, trade, space, dimension, layer, variance, pattern, balance, distribution, evolution, flow, extreme, inflection, symmetry, angle, ratio, degree, rate, comparison, tangent, diagonal, constant, distance, point, direction, edge, limit, boundary, order, position, equivalent, alternate, opposite, inverse

        - shape configurations involve different values of the parameters, which can be core components (number of sides, angle, number type, etc), that accrete into shape types with differentiating derivable/emergent attributes

        - how do constants accrete between rules, like caps to keep variance from flowing in to corners or creating openings in systems?

    - also fitting known structures & known permutations of structures to explain a possible missing object or combination in a system


  ### Object Layer & Interface Identification

    - there may be an optimal layer or other set of objects on one layer or across layers with which to frame a problem
      - when framed in this way, the problem is always solvable 
        (same operation as selecting a host system to represent a problem space, or selecting structures to represent the problem space objects themselves)
      https://twitter.com/remixerator/status/1205700297965727749

    - there may be an optimal interface to solve a problem, based on problem type or available resources (info, info-generating, variance-minimization, & other resource types)

      - evaluating solutions for system impact is a key failure point to focus on, to prevent this method from generating same error types as existing methods
      - this means identifying chains of interacting patterns that can produce variance objects (like a black swan or other types of risk chain) & at which times its likely to do so, based on chained interaction times

    - all interactions that are not predicted in a emergent problem or designed solution space are sources of variance (and also may be exploit opportunities), that can convert a solution into a problem, or occasionally produce a solution by coincidentally interacting order & variance (a mutation that generates a function to protect from a pathogen, by trial & error of which mutations survive)

    - designed objects often differ from emergent objects in chaotic ways that produce more variance rather than reduce it, unless design is built on understanding of emergent objects higher up causal chain


  ### Identifying useful object combinations

    - combine risk, cause, variance, and probability objects (uncertainty, causal loop, variance generator, probability distribution)

    - combine structural & conceptual objects (vector + priority)

    - what is the set of interface objects optimal for solving a problem of particular dimension (x, y, z) & shape a?


## Definition differentiation

  - given that most conceptual objects are related, how do you identify which are most important in determining another object?
  - identify that "intent" is highly related to "priority"
  - identify that "insight" is highly related to "strategy"
  - identify that "role" is highly related to "function"
